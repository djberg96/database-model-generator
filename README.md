## Description
A library for generating an ActiveRecord model from an existing database table.

Currently supports both Oracle and SQL Server databases.

This will install a "dmg" (Database Model Generator) executable that you can
use from the command line.

## Renamed
Originally called "oracle-model-generator" and put into the dust bin, I've
decided to revive this library with the help of AI. Specifically, I've added
SQLServer support, and plan to add Postgres support.

I also plan on lots of improvements, and some general refactoring.

## Synopsis
Using the command line tool:

### Oracle:
`dmg -T oracle -d your_database -t locations -u some_user -p some_password`

### SQL Server:
`dmg -T sqlserver -s localhost -d your_database -t locations -u sa -p your_password`

### Auto-detection:
# Oracle (default)
`dmg -d your_database -t locations -u some_user -p some_password`

# SQL Server (detected)
`dmg -s localhost -d your_database -t locations -u sa -p password`

The above command results in a file called "location.rb". This is an
ActiveRecord model declaration, with all validations, primary keys,
table name and belongs_to relationships defined.

If your LOCATIONS table looks like this:

```sql
create table locations(
  location_id number(4,0) primary key,
  street_address varchar2(40),
  postal_code varchar2(12),
  city varchar2(30) not null
  state_province varchar2(25),
  country_id CHAR(2),
  constraint "LOC_C_ID_FK" FOREIGN KEY (country_id)
    references COUNTRIES (country_id)
)
```

The dmg library will generate this:

```ruby
class Location < ActiveRecord::Base
  set_table_name :locations
  set_primary_key :location_id

  # Table relationships

  belongs_to :countries

  # Validations

  validates :location_id, :presence => true, :numericality => {
    :less_than_or_equal_to => 9999,
    :greater_than_or_equal_to => -9999,
    :only_integer => true
  }

  validates :street_address, :length => {:maximum => 40}
  validates :postal_code, :length => {:maximum => 12}
  validates :city, :length => {:maximum => 30}, :presence => true
  validates :state_province, :length => {:maximum => 25}
  validates :country_id, :length => {:maximum => 2}
end
```

It will also generate a corresponding test file using test-unit 2 by default.
For the above example you will see some tests like this:

```ruby
class TC_Location < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup
    @location = Location.new
  end

  test 'table name is locations' do
    assert_equal('locations', Location.table_name)
  end

  test 'primary key is location_id' do
    assert_equal('location_id', Location.primary_key)
  end

  test 'location_id basic functionality' do
    assert_respond_to(@location, :location_id)
    assert_nothing_raised{ @location.location_id }
    assert_kind_of(Numeric, @location.location_id)
  end

  test 'location_id must be a number' do
    @location.location_id = 'test_string'
    assert_false(@location.valid?)
    assert_true(@location.errors[:location_id].include?('is not a number'))
  end

  test 'location_id cannot exceed the value 9999' do
    @location.location_id = 10000
    assert_false(@location.valid?)
    assert_true(@location.errors[:location_id].include?('must be less than or equal to 9999'))
  end

  # ... and so on.
end
```

## Requirements
* getopt
* One of the following gems, depending on which vendor you're using.

### Oracle
* ruby-oci8

### SQLServer
* tiny_tds

## Running the specs
### Oracle:
Run `cd docker/oracle && docker-compose run --rm oracle-model-generator bundle exec rspec`.

You may need to use sudo. No guarantees on MacOS because of known issues
with database client libraries.

### SQL Server:
Run `cd docker/sqlserver && ./test.sh` to start SQL Server, then run tests.

Again, no guarantees on MacOS.

## Optional Libraries
If you want to be able to avoid specifying a username and password on the
command line then you will need the `dbi-dbrc` library.

If you want your models to support multiple primary keys, then you will
need to install the `composite_primary_keys` library.

If you want date format validations, then you will need to install the
`validates_timeliness` library.

## Database Support
* **Oracle**: Full support via ruby-oci8
* **SQL Server**: Full support via tiny_tds
* **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects database type based on connection parameters

## Author's Comments
Originally focused only on Oracle, this library has been expanded to support
SQL Server as well. The architecture now supports multiple database vendors,
and I will probably add Postgres support in the future.

## Current Features
* **Multi-database support**: Oracle and SQL Server
* **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects database type
* **Index recommendations**: Suggests optimal indexes for your tables
* **Multiple test frameworks**: Supports test-unit, minitest, and rspec
* **Docker support**: Complete Docker environments for testing both databases

## Future Plans (originally)
* Add support for views.
