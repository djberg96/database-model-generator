= 0.4.0 - 7-Nov-2014
* Added support for minitest test file output.

= 0.3.2 - 6-Nov-2014
* Removed explicit references to Rails 3 in documentation. It's now simply
  Rails 2, or Rails 3 or higher.
* Some minor updates in generated test file text, as test-unit 2 no longer
  requires the require workaround.
* Updates to Rakefile and gemspec.

= 0.3.1 - 3-Apr-2012
* Added the --class option that allows you to specify the model name on the
  command line. Thanks go to Daniel Luna for the patch (plus some minor fixes).

= 0.3.0 - 12-May-2011
* Added automatic test generation. In addition to the active record model file,
  a test file will be generated that includes a series of stock tests that
  are based on the model's validations. At the moment only test-unit is
  supported, but I'll eventually add rspec.
* Added the -x/--tests command line option for the new test generation feature.
* The dependencies method now returns an array of dependencies for the given
  table or view.
* The table method has been altered. It now returns just the plain, uppercased
  name of the table. A new method called 'model' now returns the active record
  model name.
* The default output file name will now chop any trailing 's' characters.
* More tests and comments added.

= 0.2.1 - 3-May-2011
* Fixed a bug where the omg binary blew up if you didn't have the dbi-dbrc
  library installed. It's supposed to be optional. Thanks go to Jason Roth
  for the spot.

= 0.2.0 - 8-Mar-2011
* Added the -r/--rails command line option. By default the omg binary will
  now generate Rails 3 style validations. If you want Rails 2 validations,
  specify "-r 2" on the command line.
* The numericality validations are now more strict, and will match the
  scale and precision exactly as defined instead of rounding to the nearest
  whole number, for Rails 3 anyway.

= 0.1.0 - 6-Oct-2010
* Initial release.
